# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh


# React Counter App

This is a simple counter application built as my first project using ReactJS. It demonstrates the basic concepts of React, including components, state, and event handling.

## Features

- **Increment Counter**: Increases the count by 1 each time the button is clicked.
- **Decrement Counter**: Decreases the count by 1 each time the button is clicked.
- **Reset Counter**: Resets the count back to 0.

## Getting Started

These instructions will help you set up and run the project on your local machine for development and testing.

### Prerequisites

- **Node.js**: Ensure that you have Node.js installed. You can download it from [here](https://nodejs.org/).
- **npm or yarn**: These are package managers for JavaScript. npm comes with Node.js, or you can use yarn if you prefer.

### Installing

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/react-counter-app.git
